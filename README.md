# FolderOrganizer

This script is designed to efficiently declutter any specified folder, such as the Desktop, by organizing accumulated files. It is universally applicable across different folders without the need for modifications or installations, offering a versatile solution for maintaining an organized digital workspace.

## Installation

You can directly run the code if you have python installed on your machine. Just put it on the folder that you would like to clean, go to the terminal, run it using "python file_automator.py" and you are good to GO! 

The script will then automatically scan through the folder that the file is located in for specific files and organizes them cleanly into separate folders for different file types like images, Word Documents, CSVs etc...



## Features

- Find different file types in the current directory and neatly organizes them.
- Requires no external packages. Just Python!
- Easy to understand and modify with all the duplication removed.
- Saves you time and gives you some peace of mind üòÄ‚ù§Ô∏è. I don't remember how many times I have manually cleaned up the mess on my Desktop. I used to save all the files on my Desktop and used to promise myself that I will move it to the specific folder after I am done with it. That day will not come unless my entire desktop fills up and my desktop starts looking ugly. Now I have a way to organize it better and I know where to look for my files that are on the Desktop.


## Drawbacks

- Currently there is no support for files that have the same name. I will hopefully add the code in the future. If not, it's not that difficult and I think you should be able to figure it out. You just have to add the numbers like 1,2,3... to the end of the files to make them non-unique and then store it in the directory. üöÄ

- The script seems somewhat limiting. It only organizes the files based on the extensions and the categories that the file belongs to. Although this saves some hassle, the files in the grouped will not have any relationship to one another. For example, let's you have a file 'ImportantNotes.docx' and another file 'ImportantNotes.pdf' on desktop and you placed them strategically close to each other. After you run the script, these files go into separate folder thereby spoiling your intentions ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
